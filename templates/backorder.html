            <h2>Welcome to the Backorder Prediction System</h2>
            <p>
                Backorders are products that are temporarily out of stock, but a customer is allowed to place an order
                against future stock. The problem is when a product is not immediately available, customers may not have
                the patience to wait. This results into lost sales and low customer satisfaction. In order to avoid such 
                scenarios machine learning (ML) tools can be applied to identify products that are at a risk of backorders.
                Our Backorder Prediction System helps businesses manage their inventory efficiently by predicting
                the likelihood of backorders. By analyzing factors such as lead time, current stock levels, and
                sales forecasts, the system provides valuable insights to help businesses make informed decisions
                about their inventory management.
